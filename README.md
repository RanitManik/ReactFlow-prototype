This repository contains a complex implementation of ReactFlow using the free version of `@xyflow/react`, showcasing advanced features such as custom nodes, custom edges, and complex grouping of elements.


## Features

- **Custom Nodes**: This project demonstrates how to create custom nodes with advanced styles and logic.
- **Custom Edges**: The custom edges provide dynamic behavior with interactive and visually appealing connections.
- **Complex Grouping**: Nodes and edges are grouped into logical units, making it easy to manage large flows.
- **Interactive Design**: Users can interact with the flow by dragging nodes, creating connections, and manipulating groups of nodes and edges.
